# GeoPress 🗺️📰

GeoPress is a **location-based news web application** that visualizes local news and incidents directly on a map. It helps users quickly understand **what happened, where it happened, and what is happening nearby**, all in one place.

## ❓ Problem It Solves

Traditional news platforms present information in text-heavy formats without clear geographical context. This creates several problems:

* Users cannot easily identify **incident locations**
* Local and hyperlocal news gets buried under national/global news
* Emergency or safety-related incidents are hard to track in real time
* Citizens struggle to understand what is happening **around them**

**GeoPress solves this by combining news with maps**, allowing users to visually explore incidents based on location.
